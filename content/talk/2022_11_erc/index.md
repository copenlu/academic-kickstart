Two PhD fellowships and two postdoc positions on explainable stance detection are available in CopeNLU. The positions are offered in the context of an <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/apply-grant/starting-grant">ERC Starting Grant</a> on '<a href="https://erc.europa.eu/news/erc-2021-starting-grants-results">Explainable and Robust Automatic Fact Checking (ExplainYourself)</a>'. ERC Starting Grant is a highly competitive funding program by the <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/homepage">European Research Council</a> to support the most talented early-career scientists in Europe with funding for a period of 5 years for blue-skies research to build up or expand their research groups.

ExplainYourself proposes to study explainable automatic fact checking, the task of automatically predicting the veracity of textual claims using machine learning (ML) methods, while also producing explanations about how the model arrived at the prediction. Automatic fact checking methods often use opaque deep neural network models, whose inner workings cannot easily be explained. Especially for complex tasks such as automatic fact checking, this hinders greater adoption, as it is unclear to users when the models' predictions can be trusted. Existing explainable ML methods partly overcome this by reducing the task of explanation generation to highlighting the right rationale. While a good first step, this does not fully explain how a ML model arrived at a prediction. For knowledge intensive natural language understanding (NLU) tasks such as fact checking, a ML model needs to learn complex relationships between the claim, multiple evidence documents, and common sense knowledge in addition to retrieving the right evidence. There is currently no explainability method that aims to illuminate this highly complex process. In addition, existing approaches are unable to produce diverse explanations, geared towards users with different information needs. ExplainYourself radically departs from existing work in proposing methods for explainable fact checking that more accurately reflect how fact checking models make decisions, and are useful to diverse groups of end users. It is expected that these innovations will apply to explanation generation for other knowledge-intensive NLU tasks, such as question answering or entity linking. 

In addition to the principle investigator, the two PhD students and postdocs, the project team will also include collaborators from CopeNLU as well as external collaborators.

#PhD candidates are expected to hold a Master's degree in computer science or a related relevant area or be near completion for one. There are no restrictions on citizenship, and a language certificate is not required at application time. 
#Candidates from traditionally underrepresented minorities in natural language processing are particularly encouraged to apply.

Two of the positions are expected to be filled for a starting date in autumn 2023, whereas the other two will be filled later during the project period. The official call is not up yet; in the meantime, you can leave your contact details <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/Wp6FHGbD3Z">here</a>, and we will send you the application link when it is up.
