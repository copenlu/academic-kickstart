2 papers by CopeNLU authors are accepted to appear at ACL 2021. One paper is on interpretability, examining how sparsity affects our ability to use attention as an explainability tool; whereas the other one is on scientific document understanding, introducing a new dataset for the task of cite-worthiness detection in scientific articles.
