We are delighted to share that Pepa, who has been a key member of the CopeNLU group during her PhD and postdoctoral fellowship, is now joining us as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. Pepa's research in Natural Language Processing has made significant progress in developing explainability techniques that enhance the fairness, transparency, and accountability of machine learning models. Her research, which aims to enhance the fairness, transparency, and accountability of machine learning models, particularly in the context of large language models, has already garnered significant recognition, including two prestigious awards (<a href="https://ellis.eu/news/the-ellis-phd-award-2023-recognizes-two-young-scientists-from-the-universities-in-copenhagen-and-tubingen">ELLIS</a>, <a href="https://www.informatics-europe.org/news/849-university-of-copenhagen-phd-graduate-wins-2023-best-dissertation-award.html">Informatics Europe</a>) for her PhD thesis. 

In her new role, Pepa will not only continue her research but also contribute to DIKUâ€™s educational initiatives, helping to provide essential data science skills to industry professionals. CopeNLU is excited to have her as a new faculty member and we look forward to her continued contributions to the academic community!
