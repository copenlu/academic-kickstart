## PhD position

The PhD position is fully funded for three years and open to candidates with a Master's degree or equivalent in Computer Science or a related field.
The PhD student’s research is expected to focus on explanation steering for human-centric RAG. The ideal candidate would thus have an educational background, prior research or work experience in ML or NLP.

The PhD student would be supervised by Isabelle Augenstein and co-supervised by Irina Shklovski, and also collaborate with the larger project team. In addition to a postdoc to be recruited, this includes external collaborators, including in information retrieval.

Read more about the position and apply <a href="https://employment.ku.dk/phd/?show=153280">here</a> by **1 February 2026** to be considered. 


## Postdoc position

The postdoc position is also offered for three years and open to candidates with a PhD degree in Computer Science or another relevant field.
The postdoc’s duties will be to conduct research on user-centric RAG and information needs of people interacting with AI. The ideal candidate would thus have an educational background, prior research or work experience at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing.

The postdoc would work with Irina Shklovski and Isabelle Augenstein, and also collaborate with the larger project team.
