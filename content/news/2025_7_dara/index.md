The Danish Advanced Research Academy (DARA) is <a href="https://daracademy.dk/fellowship/fellowships-summer-2025">calling for PhD fellowship applications on topics including AI</a>.
As the fellowship application process requires a letter of support from the prospective main supervisor, we are collecting and screening expressions of interest of candidates who would like to apply with Isabelle Augenstein as a main supervisor <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/HZSmgR9nXB">here</a>. Selected interested candidates will be invited to submit full applications to the DARA fellowship programme with my support.
Note that the PhD programme requires applicants to hold a Master's degree or be in the process of completing a Master's programme.

The timeline for recruitment is as follows:

- 26 June - 20 July 2025: submission of expressions of interest via <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/HZSmgR9nXB">this form</a>
- 21 July - 9 August 2025: shortlisting and screening interviews
- 10 August 2025: a small number of selected candidates are informed
- 10 - 28 August 2025: each candidate prepares DARA fellowship materials with my support
- 29 August 14:00 CEST: deadline for submission of DARA fellowship materials
- December 2025: DARA fellowship notification
