We are interested in studying method to explain relationships between inputs and outputs of black-box machine learning models, particularly in the context of challenging NLU tasks such as fact checking.

We are researching methods for explainable stance detection in the context of a <a href="https://dff.dk/en/grants/copy_of_research-leaders-2020/researchleader-14?set_language=en">DFF Sapere Aude Research Leader project</a>, and explainable fact checking as part of an <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/news-events/news/starting-grants-2022-call-results">ERC Starting Grant project</a>.

Moreover, we are investigating fair and accountable Natural Language Processing methods to understand what influences the employer images that organisations project in job ads, as part of a <a href="https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/da/Forskningsaktiviteter/Bevillingsstatistik/Bevillingsoversigt/CF22_1461_Pia-Ingold">Carlsberg-funded project</a>.
