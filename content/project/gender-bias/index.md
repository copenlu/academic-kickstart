We are working on studying methods to detect gendered language automatically using unsupervised learning methods, such as variational auto-encoders. The findings of our first paper on this (<a href="/publication/2019_acl_hoyle/">Hoyle et al., 2019</a>) have been reported by 75+ international news outlets, including <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2019/08/30/massive-machine-learning-study-demonstrates-gender-stereotyping-and-sexist-language-in-literature/">Forbes</a>.

Currently, we're interested in expanding the above to a cross-lingual study, as well as researching the relationship between gender bias and attitudes towards entities on social media as part of a <a href="https://dff.dk/en/grants/database?instrument:list=all&filed_method:list=all&period:list=all&set_language=en&SearchableText=gender-biased">project funded by DFF</a>.
