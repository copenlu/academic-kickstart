Question answering is concerned with answer user questions, either in a closed-domain or open-domain setting automatically.
We are interested in exploiting synergies between question answering and related tasks, such as framing entailment or relation extraction as question answering tasks.
Further research interests are question answering in conversational settings, such as for chatbots.

We were prevously involved in two funded projects related to this theme: a project on subjectivity in question answering, funded by a faculty research award from <a href="https://www.megagon.ai/">Megagon Labs</a>; as well a PhD fellowship grant on conversational question answering for customer support from <a href="https://www.botxo.ai/">BotXO</a>, which <a href="/authors/ana-valeria-gonzalez/">Ana Valeria Gonzalez</a> works on.
