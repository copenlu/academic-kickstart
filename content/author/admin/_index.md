CopeNLU is a Natural Language Processing research group led by <a href="http://isabelleaugenstein.github.io">Isabelle Augenstein</a> and <a href="https://apepa.github.io/">Pepa Atanasova</a> with a focus on researching methods for tasks that require a deep understanding of language, as opposed to shallow processing.
We are affiliated with the <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/research/nlp/">Natural Language Processing Section</a>, as well as with the <a href="https://www.aicentre.dk/">Pioneer Centre for AI</a>, at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen. We are interested in core methodology research on, among others, learning with limited training data and explainable AI; as well as applications thereof to tasks such as fact checking, gender bias detection and question answering. Our group is partly funded by an ERC Starting Grant on <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101077481">Explainable and Robust Automatic Fact Checking</a>, as well as a Sapere Aude Research Leader fellowship on <a href="https://dff.dk/en/grants/research-leaders-2020/researchleader-14">`Learning to Explain Attitudes on Social Media'</a>.
