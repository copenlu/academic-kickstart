We gave a tutorial on 'Explainability for NLP' at the first ALPS (Advanced Language Processing) winter school: http://lig-alps.imag.fr/index.php/schedule/
The tutorial introduces the concepts of 'model understanding' as well as 'decision understanding' and provides examples of approaches from the areas of fact checking and text classification.

Exercises for both model understanding and decision understanding are available here: https://github.com/copenlu/ALPS_2021
