2 papers by CopeNLU authors are accepted to appear at ACL 2019. One paper is on uncovering probabilistic implications in typological knowledge bases, following up from our <a href="/publication/2019_naacl_bjerva/">NAACL 2019 paper on generative linguistic typology</a>; whereas the other one is on unsupervised discovery of gendered language, utilising the <a href="/publication/2019_naacl_hoyle/">multi-view autoencoder introduced in our NAACL 219 paper</a>.
